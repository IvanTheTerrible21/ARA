Artificial Runner Assistant Prototype
 My first mini project for my Fundamentals Program's Final.
 in case you want to custom any commands, you can insert it on Section Command List (yeah manually), i want to use API for my program for immersive NLP but i realise all that API is paid.

 Changelog 1.1.3 :
   - Add Chatbox
   - Add command to ask for current time
   - Add command to ask for current days, date, also year
